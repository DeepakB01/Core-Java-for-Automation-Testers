Question # 1 : - Are static methods inherited in Java?
Answer: - 

package new1;
public class Person {
	public static void display(){
		System.out.println("This is Parent Class Static Method");
	}
}

package new1;
public class Employer extends Person {
   public void show() 
   {
      display();  //this also works perfactly fine
   }   
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Person.display(); // this is one of the way to call public static method of parent class
    Employer.display(); // this also works because static methods become part of sub-class which is inheriting the parent class
	}

}

Static methods which are inherited by sub-class can not be overridden. In case you decide to create a static method of same signature as 
defined in super-class then static method of super-class will be hidden
